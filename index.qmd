The `adsense` extension allows you to incorporate [Google Adsense](https://adsense.google.com/start/) ad's on various [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) formats, including [HTML](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html), [Websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), and [Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books). 

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/coatless-quarto/adsense)

This extension is required as [Quarto does **not** natively support Google Adsense](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/2898#discussioncomment-3905621), but [does have support for Google Analytics](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html#google-analytics).

## Installation

To install the `adsense` extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Execute the following command:

```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/adsense
```

This command will download and install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory of your Quarto project. If you are using version control, ensure that you include this directory in your repository.

## Usage

There are two ways you can setup the extension: 1. in a separate configuration file (`_quarto.yml` or `_metadata.yml`) or 2. inside a document's header.

### Multi-page Projects: Websites

If you have a website or book, you can use either the [`_quarto.yml`](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#project-metadata) or [`_metadata.yml`](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#directory-metadata) files to avoid needing to consistently set the value. This means, you would only need to include:

```yml
adsense:
  publisher-id: ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

filters:
- adsense
```

For more information, please see Quarto's documentation on [Shared Metadata](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#shared-metadata).

### Single Page Projects: HTML Document

If you only have one HTML document, we recommend setting up the extension by placing the required fields into the document's header section, e.g.

```yml

  publisher-id: ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
