This means, you would only need to include:\nadsense:\n  publisher-id: ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nfilters:\n- adsense\nFor more information, please see Quarto’s documentation on Shared Metadata.\n\n\nSingle Page Projects: HTML Document\nIf you only have one HTML document, we recommend setting up the extension by placing the required fields into the document’s header section, e.g.\n---\ntitle: \"Demo Setup\"\nauthor: \"FirstName LastName\"\nadsense:\n  publisher-id: ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nfilters:\n- adsense\n---",
