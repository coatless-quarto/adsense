   Set up the extension globally by incorporating the relevant configuration in either the [`_quarto.yml`](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#project-metadata) or [`_metadata.yml`](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#directory-metadata) file. This ensures consistent usage across all documents in your project.

2. [Document-specific Configuration in YAML Header](qgads-ad-global-configuration.qmd):
