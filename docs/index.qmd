The `adsense` extension allows you to incorporate [Google Adsense](https://adsense.google.com/start/) ad's on various [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) formats, including [HTML](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html), [Websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), and [Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books). This extension is required as [Quarto does **not** natively support Google Adsense](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/2898#discussioncomment-3905621), but [does have support for Google Analytics](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html#google-analytics).

Ready to get started? Check out the [installation steps](qgads-installation.qmd) and the preferred [setup approach using a global configuration](qgads-ad-global-configuration.qmd).

This Quarto extension is open source software and is **not affiliated with** Google. The extension is at best a community effort to simplify the integration of Google's Adsense product inside of Quarto websites.
