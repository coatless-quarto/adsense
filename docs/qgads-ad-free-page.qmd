## Overview

This example demonstrates how to disable ads on specific pages by utilizing a YAML configuration setting. By following these steps, you can easily prevent the insertion of Google Adsense units on individual pages, ensuring an ad-free experience for your users on pages that you do not wish to monetize.

## Configuration

To disable ads on a per-page basis, insert the following code snippet into the YAML header of the desired page:

```yaml
adsense:
  enable-ads: false
```

## Result

Upon setting `enable-ads` to `false`, the Google Adsense unit will not be included in the specified page. Consequently, ads will be effectively disabled, providing a cleaner and ad-free presentation for users accessing that particular page.
